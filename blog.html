<h3> 1) What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems? </h3>

<p>The most challenging thing about the assignment was understanding how handlebars worked. Everything else seemed to fall apart quite
easily. Oddly enough, I should've struggled more with the server.js, but that just wasn't the case. I solved this problem by looking 
through the recorded lectures.</p>

<h3>2) What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h3>

<p>What I learned from the assignment was how to use additional terminal commands and the like. I found that I knew very little about
what the assignment asked before being tasked to do it.</p>

<h3>3) What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Campuswire forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h3>

<p>The most useful resources were the online lectures, as I stated previously that I learned more about handlebars from the uploaded videos.</p>
<p>I was able to utilize a video transcript feature to find what I needed to learn. It appears it's something only mac has. Not sure though.</p>
<p>I found that asking TAs for help was hit or miss. It often depended on how much time they were willing to give.</p>

<h3>4) What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>

<p>I had to google a lot of things. For one, I had to google the commands for ending certain processes in terminal. Additionally,</p>
<p>I wanted to know more about the "node_modules" I downloaded. So I looked into what they were.</p>
